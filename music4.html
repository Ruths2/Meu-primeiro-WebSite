          (Once upon a time, not so long ago)<br>
          <br>
          Tommy used to work on the docks<br>
          Union's been on strike, he's down on his <br>
          It's tough, so tough<br>
          Gina works the diner all day<br>
          Working for her man, she brings home her pay<br>
          For love, for love<br>
          <br>
          She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
          It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
          We've got each other and that's a lot<br>
          For love, we'll give it a shot<br>
          <br>
          Whoa, we're halfway there<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          <br>
          Tommy's got his six string in hock<br>
          Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk<br>
          So tough, it's tough<br>
          Gina dreams of running away<br>
          When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers<br>
          Baby, it's okay, someday<br>
          <br>
          We've got to hold on to what we've got<br>
          It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not<br>
          We've got each other and that's a lot<br>
          For love, we'll give it a shot<br>
          <br>
          Whoa, we're halfway there<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Living on a prayer<br>
          <br>
          Ooh, we've got to hold on, ready or not<br>
          You live for the fight when that's all that you've got<br>
          <br>
          Whoa, we're halfway there<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          <br>
          Whoa, we're halfway there<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          <br>
          Whoa, we're halfway there<br>
          Oh-oh, living on a prayer<br>
          Take my hand<br>
